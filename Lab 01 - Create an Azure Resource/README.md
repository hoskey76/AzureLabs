# Create an Azure Resource
## Overview

In this lab, you’ll use the Azure portal to create a resource. The main focus here is observing how Azure resource groups populate with created resources. 


## ⚠️ Cost & Resource Disclaimer  

These labs and projects are designed with free or low-cost Azure resources whenever possible. If you attempt to replicate them in your own Azure environment, be aware that **some costs may be incurred depending on your configuration and resource choices**.  

- Whenever possible, use a **sandbox environment** (e.g., Microsoft Learn sandbox).  
- Take advantage of **resources provided by your employer, school, or training platform** if available.  
- **Always shut down or delete resources** once you’ve completed a lab to avoid unexpected charges from services left running.  

Use these labs responsibly and with cost-awareness in mind.
