# Create a Virtual Machine and Configure Network Access
## Overview
This lab is split into two parts.

1. Creating a Linux VM and installing Nginx
2. Configuring access to the Linux VM

   
In **Part 1** you'll create a Linux VM and install Nginx. After your VM is created, you'll use the Custom Script Extension to install Nginx.  The VM you created and installed Nginx on won't be accessible on the Internet so, in **Part 2** you'll configure the access to the virtual machine (VM) you created in **Part 1**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Custom Script Extension is an easy way to download and run scripts on your Azure VMs. It's just one of the many ways you can configure the system after your VM is up and running.
