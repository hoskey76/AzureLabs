# AzureLabs
Labs and projects for practice in Azure

These labs are used in part to prep for Azure certifications as well as for practical application of cloud resources.


> [!NOTE]
> For some of these labs there will also be a guided walk-through, which will be linked in the lab and posted to my website www.rashaunhoskey.com


## Azure Subscription Requirement  

To complete these labs, you will need an **active Azure subscription**.  

If you don’t already have one, you can [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) which includes:  
- $200 in credits for the first 30 days  
- Access to popular free services for 12 months  
- 25+ services that are always free  


## ⚠️ Cost & Resource Disclaimer  

These labs and projects are designed with free or low-cost Azure resources whenever possible. If you attempt to replicate them in your own Azure environment, be aware that **some costs may be incurred depending on your configuration and resource choices**.  

- Whenever possible, use a **sandbox environment** (e.g., Microsoft Learn sandbox).  
- Take advantage of **resources provided by your employer, school, or training platform** if available.  
- **Always shut down or delete resources** once you’ve completed a lab to avoid unexpected charges from services left running.  

Use these labs responsibly and with cost-awareness in mind.
