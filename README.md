# AzureLabs
Labs for practice in an Azure Cloud environment

These labs ar used in part to prep for Azure certifications as well as for practical application of cloud resources.

[!NOTE]
> For some of these labs I will have also made a guided walk-through, if there is one, it will be linked in the lab and posted to my website www.rashaunhoskey.com
